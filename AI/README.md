This Directory <project>/AI contains miscellaneous directives for AI. 

Why do we do this? Because AI is a powerful ally in development workflow. 
AI needs information and intent to work properly. 

Firstly, the code is thorougly documented in the actual files.
Second, a corresponding <file>.md can be found where information useful 
to both humans and AI can be found, such as further directives, blueprints, 
or project scope / context information.
